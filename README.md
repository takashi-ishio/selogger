SELogger is a Java Agent to record an [execution trace](#execution-trace) of a Java program.
The tool name "SE" means Software Engineering, because the tool is developed for software engineering research topics including omniscient debugging. 

The design of this tool is partly explained in the following articles.

## Build

Build a jar file with Maven.

        mvn package

SELogger uses ASM (http://asm.ow2.org/) for injecting logging code.
The class names are shaded by maven-shade-plugin so that 
SELogger can manipulate a program using ASM. 

### How to Build for JDK7

selogger works with JDK 7 while selogger's test cases requires JDK 8 to test the behavior of INVOKEDYNAMIC instructions.
If you would like to build a jar file for JDK7, please skip compilation of test classes as follows.
  - Prepare JDK 7 and Maven.
  - Replace the JDK version `1.8` with `1.7` for the `maven-compiler-plugin` in `pom.xml`.
  - Execute `mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true`.


## Usage

Execute your program with the Java Agent.

        java -javaagent:path/to/selogger-0.3.1.jar [Application Options]

The agent accepts options.  Each option is specified by `option=value` style with commas (","). For example:

        java -javaagent:path/to/selogger-0.3.1.jar=output=dirname,format=freq [Application Options]


### Output Options

The `output=` option specifies a directory to store an execution trace.  
The directory is automatically created if it does not exist.
The default output directory is `selogger-output`.
You can include `{time}` in the directory name (e.g. `output=selogger-output-{time}`).  The part is replaced by a number indicating the current time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond).

The `format=` option specifies an output format.  The default is `latest` format.  The details of each option is described in the [DataFormat.md](DataFormat.md) file.

  * `freq` mode records only a frequency table of events.
  * `latest` mode records the latest event data with timestamp and thread ID for each bytecode location. 
  * `nearomni` mode is an alias of `latest`.
  * `omni` mode records all the events in a stream.
  * `discard` mode discard event data, while it injects logging code into classes.

In the `latest`/`nearomni` mode, three additional options are available:
  * `size=` specifies the size of buffers (the number of recorded events per source code location).  The default is 32.
  * `keepobj={strong|weak|id}` specifies how to record objects in a trace.
    * (Default) `keepobj=strong` keeps all objects in recent events. 
    * `keepobj=weak` keeps objects using weak references to avoid the impact to GC.  It reduces memory consumption, while some object information may be lost.
    * `keepobj=id` assigns unique IDs to objects in the same way as `format=omni`.  This option maintains an object-to-id map on memory but may reduce memory consumption.
    * For compatibility with previous versions of SELogger, `keepobj={true|false}` is regarded as `keepobj={strong|weak}`, respectively. 
  * `json={true|false}` specifies whether the output file is written in a JSON format or not.
    * The default value is false.


### Logging Target Event Options

The `weave=` option specifies events to be recorded. Supported event groups are: 

  * EXEC (entry/exit)
  * CALL (call)
  * PARAM (parameters for method entries and calls)
  * FIELD (field access)
  * ARRAY (array creation and access)
  * OBJECT (constant object usage)
  * SYNC (synchronized blocks)
  * LOCAL (local variables)
  * LABEL (conditional branches)
  * LINE (line numbers)
  * ALL (All events listed above)

You can add multiple groups in a single option using `+`.  
The dafault configuration is `EXEC+CALL+FIELD+ARRAY+SYNC+OBJECT+PARAM`.

The default configuration records all events. 

Note: The event category names EXEC and CALL come from AspectJ pointcut: execution and call.


### Excluding Libraries from Logging

Logging may generate a huge amount of events. 
You can manually exclude some classes from logging by specifying filtering options.

You can find a list of loaded classes in the `log.txt` file generated by SELogger.  
A message `Weaving executed: [Class Name] loaded from [URI]` shows a pair of class name and location.

#### Filtering by Package and Class Names

Using `e=` option, you can specify a prefix of class names excluded from the logging process.  
You can use multiple `e=` options to enumerate class paths.
By default, the selogger excludes the system classes from logging: `sun/`,`com/sun/`, `java/`, and `javax/`.

If a class is excluded from logging by this filter, a log message `Excluded by name filter: (the class name)` is recorded in a log file.

#### Filtering by File Location

Using `exlocation=` option, you can exclude classes loaded from a particular directory or JAR file.
If a specified string is included in a URI where the class is loaded, that class is excluded from logging.
For example, you can exclude classes loaded from Maven dependencies by using `exlocation=.m2` option.

You can use multiple `exlocation=` options to enumerate file paths.
By default, no location filter is configured.

If a class is excluded from logging by this filter, a log message `Excluded by class filter: (the class name) loaded from (location name)` is recorded in a log file.


#### Infinite loop risk 

The security manager mechanism of Java Virtual Machine may call a `checkPermission` method to check whether a method call is allowed in the current context or not.
When a custom security manager having a `checkPermission` method is defined in a target program, SELogger injects logging code into the method by default. 
The logging code tries to record an execution of `checkPermission`.  
The logging step triggers an additional `checkPermission` call, and results in infinite recursive calls.

To reduce the risk of infinite recursive calls, SELogger automatically detects a subclass of SecurityManager and exclude the class from weaving.
If such a class is detected, a log message `Excluded security manager subclass` is recorded.
If you would like to weave logging code into such a subclass, add `weavesecuritymanager=true` option.


### Option for Troubleshooting

The `dump=true` option stores class files including logging code into the output directory. It may help a debugging task if invalid bytecode is generated. 


## Execution Trace


The following table is a list of events that can be recorded by SELogger.

## Package Structure

SELogger comprises three sub-packages: `logging`, `reader`, and `weaver`.

  - The `weaver` sub-package is an implementation of Java Agent.  
    - RuntimeWeaver class is the entry point of the agent.  It calls ClassTransformer to inject logging instructions into target classes.
  - The `logging` sub-package implements logging features.
    - Logging class is the entry point of the logging feature.  It records runtime events in files.
  - The `reader` sub-package implements classes to read log files.
    - LogPrinter class is an example to read `.slg` files generated by logging classes. 



 
 
## Limitation

The logging feature for some instructions (in particular, JUMP, RET, INVOKEDYNAMIC instructions) has not been tested well due to the lack of appropriate test cases.

To record Local variable names and line numbers, the tool uses debugging information embedded in class files. 


## History

The first version of SELogger (in `icpc204` branch) is a static weaver for omniscient debugging .
The execution trace recorded in this version is incompatible with the branch version.
The major differences are:
 * Simplified data format
 * Simplified instrumentation implementation
 * Simplified logging implementation (easy to extend)
 * Supported load-time weaving
 * Supported tracing jumps caused by exceptions
 * Supported fixed-size buffer logging
 * Improved reliability with JUnit test cases

Please note that the documentation in the `doc` directory was written for the old version.
We still keep the files for the record.
